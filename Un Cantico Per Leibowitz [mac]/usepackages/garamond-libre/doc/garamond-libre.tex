\section*{Introduction}

Garamond Libre is a free and open-source old-style font
family. It is a ``true Garamond,'' i.e., it is based off the
designs of 16th-century French engraver Claude Garamond
(also spelled Garamont). The Roman design is Garamond’s;
the italics are from a design by Robert Granjon. The upright
Greek font is after a design by Firmin Didot; the ``italic''
Greek font is after a design by Alexander Wilson. The font
family includes support for Latin, Greek (monotonic and
polytonic) and Cyrillic scripts, as well as small capitals,
old-style figures, superior and inferior figures, historical
ligatures, Byzantine musical symbols, the IPA and swash
capitals. The fonts are an extended fork based on designs by
George Douros. 



Garamond Libre is based on George Douros' text fonts
project. The sources on which these fonts are based were
released by their author as free for any use.

The Type 1 versions of the fonts were created using \texttt{cfftot1}.
The support files were created using \texttt{autoinst} and \texttt{otftotfm}
and are licensed under the terms of the \LaTeX\ Project Public
License.
