This is the README for the garamond-libre package, 
version 1.4 (2024-04-23)

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Garamond Libre family of fonts.
Garamond Libre is a free and open-source old-style font
family. It is a "true Garamond," i.e., it is based off the
designs of 16th-century French engraver Claude Garamond
(also spelled Garamont). The Roman design is Garamondâ€™s;
the italics are from a design by Robert Granjon. The upright
Greek font is after a design by Firmin Didot; the "italic"
Greek font is after a design by Alexander Wilson. The font
family includes support for Latin, Greek (monotonic and
polytonic) and Cyrillic scripts, as well as small capitals,
old-style figures, superior and inferior figures, historical
ligatures, Byzantine musical symbols, the IPA and swash
capitals. The fonts are an extended fork based on designs by
George Douros. 

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/garamond-libre.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file GaramondLibre.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{garamondlibre}

to the preamble of your document. Options include:

oldstyle,osf    old-style figures
lining,lf       lining figures

The default is lining. 

Available shapes include:

it              italic
sc              small caps
scit            italic small caps

Slanted variants are not supported; the italic variants will
be automatically substituted. Font encodings supported are
OT1, T1, TS1, LY1, T2A, T2B, T2C and LGR.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
adjust fontsizes. The type1 option may be used by xelatex
or lualatex users who prefer to use type1 fonts or to avoid
fontspec.

Commands \oldstylenums{...} and \liningnums{...} are defined
to allow for local use of old-style figures or lining
figures, respectively.

Superior numbers (for footnote markers) are available
using \sufigures or \textsu{...}. Inferior numbers (for
subscripts) are available using \infigures or \textinf{...}.
Swash italic glyphs (for some letters) are available using
\textsw{...}. A few ornaments [1-9] are available using 
\textornaments{..}

Command \garamondlibrelgr activates the LGR encoding of type1
fonts.
